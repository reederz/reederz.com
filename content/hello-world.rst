:summary: I'm a Web Developer, yet I've been postponing my site for years. I guess today is a good day to start.


I'm particularly bored today. Not that I don't have anything to do, it's just that I don't want to do anything. F*** it, I'll start a blog. It's been long overdue anyway. Honestly, I've tried launching my personal site 5 times in the past. I'd dig up some new web framework, program the blogging software and give up before the launch. In retrospect, back then, I was only interested in learning the particular frameworks/languages and not so much in blogging. But it's different now.(..?)

A bit about me: I'm a 24 year old dude who's interested in software security, automation and semantic web. I spend most of my time hanging out at `fadeit <http://fadeit.dk/en>`_, reading `weird Sci-Fi books <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68497.The_Scar>`_, watching old movies and etc. Who knows, perhaps blogging will become my thing too (don't expect any kind of regularity). 

Cheers,

Justas
