My name is Justas. I'm a programmer interested in Web, Linux, Privacy and Decentralization. This is my personal site where I'll sometimes write about that (and perhaps some other stuff).

If you're looking for a freelance web developer or sysadmin, you can contact me through my company - `fadeit <http://fadeit.dk/en>`_.
