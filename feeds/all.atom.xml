Unlike other similar platforms, such as &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://upwork.com"&gt;upwork&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://freelancer.com"&gt;freelancer.com&lt;/a&gt;, this one is pretty hard to get in. They hire top 3% of freelance talent and they have a tough interviewing process to ensure&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, why would you want to be a part of toptal? I&amp;#8217;ve tried a couple other freelancing platforms and I didn&amp;#8217;t really like them that much. Since there is little to no skill assesment of the freelancers and a huge competition, you have to invest a lot of effort into justifying your skills to the clients every single time. Toptal is different. Because of the hard screening process, merely by passing it you have proven that you are good at what you do (and the clients know&amp;nbsp;that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screening process itself has &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.toptal.com/top-3-percent#select-just-spectacular-programmers-now"&gt;4 stages&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skype interview with an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HR&lt;/span&gt; person to assess your English skills and&amp;nbsp;personality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timed algorithm test: 3 coding exercises in 90 minutes on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://codility.com"&gt;codility&lt;/a&gt; platform to assess your problem solving and algorithm&amp;nbsp;skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Live technical screening with a Sr. Engineer where you are asked technical questions and have to do live&amp;nbsp;programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A test project to prove that you are capable of working on a real life project. The project takes around 2 weeks to complete after which you have to present it to &amp;#8220;the client&amp;#8221; (one of toptal&amp;nbsp;engineers).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stages 2-4 were the most challenging and I&amp;#8217;ve initially failed the 3rd stage because I ran out of time when doing the live coding. Fortunately, they let you retry it after 1 month and I was luckier with my second&amp;nbsp;attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got accepted and setup &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.toptal.com/resume/justas-azna#select-just-spectacular-programmers-now"&gt;my profile&lt;/a&gt; I could apply for jobs (yeah, you still have to do that). But since I was busy at the moment, I put it on hold. Even so, a few weeks later one of the recruiters found me an interview and after talking to the client I got hired as a Senior Software&amp;nbsp;Developer/Architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, my short experience with Toptal is very good and I&amp;#8217;m happy to have joined their network. Go ahead and check them out, if you are &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.toptal.com/talent/apply#select-just-spectacular-programmers-now"&gt;looking for challening and exciting software projects&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.toptal.com/companies/apply#select-just-spectacular-programmers-now"&gt;are in need of help with one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It was an interesting and challenging&amp;nbsp;experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course took 6 weeks and covered Stream and Block Ciphers, Message Integrity, Authenticated Encryption, Basic Key Exchange and Public Key Encryption. We have discussed several formal security definitions such as Semantic Security, Chosen Plaintext Security, Chosen Ciphertext Security, Collision Resistance; each of which were used to describe security of different cryptographic&amp;nbsp;primitives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each week we would have a problem set which usually consisted of multiple-choice questions and an optional programming assignment. The programming assignments were especially great: we got to break poorly used cryptography and practice using various crypto algorithms I.e. we have broken many-time-pad, exploited &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CBC&lt;/span&gt; padding oracle vulnerabilities, factored &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSA&lt;/span&gt; modulus with poorly generated prime factors and&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 6 weeks we had the final exam where we reviewed what we have done throughout the&amp;nbsp;course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main takeaways for me&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;never roll your own&amp;nbsp;crypto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don&amp;#8217;t even try to implement crypto standards- stick to standard, peer-reviewed and battle-tested&amp;nbsp;implementations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;paranoia level&amp;nbsp;up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this course is really fun, it&amp;#8217;s not something that you can do casually. It would take me 6-12 quality hours every week to watch the lectures and finish the course work. It&amp;#8217;s actually my second attempt- the first time I gave up because my schedule was too hectic and I didn&amp;#8217;t want to invest half ass effort into this (all or nothing&amp;nbsp;:).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before crypto1, I had a course on computer security in college, read books like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29608.The_Codebreakers"&gt;The Codebreakers by David Khan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9319468-kingpin"&gt;Kingpin by Kevin Poulsen&lt;/a&gt;, dabbled with hacking challenges on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.hackthissite.org/"&gt;HackThisSite&lt;/a&gt; and had some experience from my sysadmin/webdev work. Shortly: I knew a bit more than average Joe. Well, this course made me feel like I know nothing about crypto (in a good way) and that was a really sobering experience. It&amp;#8217;s definitely going to affect my decisions both as webdev and as a web&amp;nbsp;citizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final note, I want to thank Prof. Dan Boneh- you really know your stuff and I admire your work. I look forward to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto2"&gt;Cryptography &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in&amp;nbsp;October.&lt;/p&gt;
