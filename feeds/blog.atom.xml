Not that I don't have anything to do, it's just that I don't want to do anything. F*** it, I'll start a blog. It's been long overdue anyway. Honestly, I've tried launching my personal site 5 times in the past. I'd dig up some new web framework, program the blogging software and give up before the launch. In retrospect, back then, I was only interested in learning the particular frameworks/languages and not so much in blogging. But it's different now.(..?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit about me: I'm a 24 year old dude who's interested in software security, automation and semantic web. I spend most of my time hanging out at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://fadeit.dk/en"&gt;fadeit&lt;/a&gt;, reading &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68497.The_Scar"&gt;weird Sci-Fi books&lt;/a&gt;, watching old movies and etc. Who knows, perhaps blogging will become my thing too (don't expect any kind of regularity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I'm well aware that The Internet &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/"&gt;does not forget&lt;/a&gt; so I'll try to stay as &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCU_%28film%29"&gt;politically correct&lt;/a&gt; as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justas&lt;/p&gt;
